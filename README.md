# Sales-Data-ETL-and-Visualization

## Project Summary: ETL and Visualization
### Overview
ETL, short for Extract, Transform, and Load, is a foundational method in data engineering. It comprises three primary phases:

*Extract:* Data is retrieved from one or multiple sources. For this project, a publicly available CSV dataset from Kaggle was selected.

*Transform:* Once extracted, the data undergoes transformations such as cleaning, filtering, validation, and aggregation.

*Load:* In the final phase, the processed data is imported into a destination system like a database, data warehouse, or data lake.

### Project Layout
The project is divided into three core directories, each dedicated to a distinct stage:

*Extract & Transform:* Contains a Python script that reads a large CSV file and processes it into multiple smaller CSV files, each designed to represent a table in the upcoming SQL database.

*Database:* Involves the creation of the SQL database and loading the transformed datasets into their respective tables.

*Dashboard:* Holds a dashboard built for analyzing the curated and structured data.

Each of these directories features its own README.md file, offering detailed guidance on setup, execution, and usage.

### How to Begin
To get started, download the project and save it locally. In the Database folder, make sure to delete all existing CSV files (they will be regenerated by the script in the Extract & Transform directory). It's recommended to place the project inside a newly created folder, then open it using VS Code or your favorite text editor. Follow the specific instructions mentioned in each folder's README.md to run the project successfully.

### Source of Dataset
Kaggle Dataset: Superstore Sales Dataset

The dataset consists of fictional sales data from a retail superstore and serves as the foundation for this project.
